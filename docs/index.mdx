:::important FireCMS is an **open source headless CMS and admin panel** built by developers for developers.
:::


FireCMS uses [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) as a **backend**. You are
the **owner** of your Firebase project, and FireCMS is a tool that helps you build your
admin panel on top of it. FireCMS provides all the editing options you lack in a simple Firebase project.

FireCMS 3.0 is the latest version of FireCMS. At this moment, it is in beta
and it can be used in the hosted version of FireCMS, [FireCMS Cloud](https://app.firecms.co). You also have self-hosted
options in the **PRO** plan.

:::tip NEW
FireCMS Cloud is the hosted version of FireCMS. It is a **fully managed
service** that allows you to **create and manage your content** in a
**user-friendly interface**.

With FireCMS Cloud you can visualize and edit your Firestore data **without writing a single line of code**,
**but** you can upload your own code and define your custom properties, form fields, dashboards, views, etc.
:::

## Features

- **Fully managed service**. No need to worry about infrastructure, security,
scalability or maintenance.
- **User-friendly interface**. FireCMS Cloud provides a user-friendly interface
to visualize and edit your Firestore data.
- **Collection editor**. Create and edit your collections and documents in a
friendly interface. No need to write a single line of code.
- **Users and roles**. Create users and roles to manage access to your data.
- **Custom code**. You can upload your own code and define your custom
properties, views, etc. in the hosted version of FireCMS.


## Getting started

You can use FireCMS Cloud with your existing Firestore project, or let it create
a new one for you.

Just sign up and start using it!

<DocsCloudCTA/>

After you have created your FireCMS project, you can either use it directly or [customize it
by uploading your own code](./cloud/quickstart).


## Current limitations

The current version of FireCMS Cloud does not support customizing the login methods or using a custom
datasource, as compared to the previous version of FireCMS.

For a higher degree of customization, check out [PRO offering](./pro). If you need support, feel free to
reach us in our [Discord channel](https://discord.gg/fxy7xsQm3m) or at [hello@firecms.co](hello@firecms.co)


### Navigation

FireCMS takes care of the navigation for you, it generates routes and menus based
on the configuration that you set up.

:::tip
The collections can be defined asynchronously, so you can fetch data from your backend
to build them.
It might be useful if you want to build the collections based on the logged-in user,
or if you want to fetch some data to build the schema of your collections.
Check the [dynamic collections](./collections/dynamic_collections.md) section for more information.
:::

You have two main ways of creating the top level views in FireCMS, either creating entity
collections that get mapped to CMS views, or create your own top level React views:
- Check all the possible configurations for defining [collections](./collections/collections.md)
- Otherwise, you can define your own [custom top level views](./custom_top_level_views.mdx).
