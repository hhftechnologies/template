import { DocsCloudCTA } from "../../src/DocsCloudCTA";

:::note
Start here if you want to customize FireCMS.
You can run a FireCMS 3.0 project without writing a single line of code
from [FireCMS Cloud](https://app.firecms.co).
:::

In order to add custom code to your FireCMS project, you need:
- A Firebase project
- A FireCMS project

You can create both projects from FireCMS Cloud.
<DocsCloudCTA/>

Once you have both projects created you can initialize your codebase by running:

```
npx create-firecms-app
```

or

```
yarn create firecms-app
```

This will create a new folder with all the code you need to get started.
In the code you will be able to add custom collections, custom pages, custom
fields, custom actions, custom properties, etc.


## Running your project

To run your project locally, you can run the following command, like any
other Vite project:

```
yarn dev
```

This will execute a version of your project that uses FireCMS backend to
store config data but runs locally.

You should be able to see your FireCMS instance in your browser, awesome!

If you want to deploy to FireCMS cloud your module must export a
`FireCMSAppConfig` object. You can find more information about this object
in the [App config section](./app_config) reference.

:::important
Vite uses the default url `http://127.0.0.1:5173` for the development server
in versions of `node` < 18.0.0.
If you are using a version of node < 18.0.0, you will need to add this url to
the authorized domains in the Firebase console.
Firebase Auth will require to add this url to the authorized domains in the
Firebase console.
Alternatively, you can use the url `http://localhost:5173`.
