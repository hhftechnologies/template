If you are migrating from previous beta versions of FireCMS Cloud, you will need to make some updates to your project.

### Dependencies

The main package has been renamed from `firecms` to `@firecms/cloud` since version `3.0.0-beta.4`.
You can also remove the `@firecms/cli` package, as it is implicitly installed by `@firecms/cloud`.

This is a sample `package.json` with the new config:
```
{
  "name": "my-firecms-project",
  "private": true,
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "type": "module",
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "vite --port 5001",
    "build": "vite build",
    "serve": "vite preview --port 5001",
    "deploy": "run-s build && firecms deploy --project=firecms-demo-27150"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "@firecms/cloud": "^3.0.0-beta",
    "firebase": "^10.9.0",
    "react": "^18.3.1",
    "react-dom": "^18.3.1"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "@originjs/vite-plugin-federation": "^1.3.5",
    "@tailwindcss/typography": "^0.5.10",
    "@types/react": "^18.2.71",
    "@types/react-dom": "^18.2.22",
    "@vitejs/plugin-react": "^4.2.1",
    "autoprefixer": "^10.4.19",
    "npm-run-all": "^4.1.5",
    "postcss": "^8.4.38",
    "tailwindcss": "^3.4.1",
    "typescript": "^5.4.3",
    "vite": "^5.2.6"
  }
}
```

### Imports

You need to update your imports to use the new package name. For example, if you have a file that imports `firecms`:

```javascript
import { FireCMS } from "firecms";
```

You need to update it to use the new package name:

```javascript
import { FireCMS } from "@firecms/cloud";
```

### Vite configuration

You also need to update your `vite.config.js` file to include the new package name and config:

```javascript
import { defineConfig } from "vite"
import react from "@vitejs/plugin-react"
import federation from "@originjs/vite-plugin-federation"

// https://vitejs.dev/config/
export default defineConfig({
    esbuild: {
        logOverride: { "this-is-undefined-in-esm": "silent" }
    },
    plugins: [
        react(),
        federation({
            name: "remote_app",
            filename: "remoteEntry.js",
            exposes: {
                "./config": "./src/index"
            },
            shared: [
                "react", "react-dom", "@firecms/cloud", "@firecms/core", "@firecms/firebase", "@firecms/ui",
            ]
        })
    ],
    build: {
        modulePreload: false,
        target: "esnext",
        cssCodeSplit: false,
    }
})
```

### Tailwind CSS

- You need to add the tailwind typography plugin to your project. You can do this by installing the `@tailwindcss/typography` package:

  ```bash
  yarn add -D @tailwindcss/typography
  ```

- You should also make sure you are using at least version `3.4.3` of the `tailwindcss` package, and `postcss` version `8.4.38`.

- The preset now comes from the `@firecms/ui` package. You can update your `tailwind.config.cjs` file to include the new preset:

  ```javascript
  import fireCMSConfig from "@firecms/ui/tailwind.config.js";

  export default {
      presets: [fireCMSConfig],
      content: [
          "./index.html",
          "./src/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}",
          "./node_modules/firecms/src/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}",
          "./node_modules/@firecms/**/src/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}",
      ],
  };
  ```
