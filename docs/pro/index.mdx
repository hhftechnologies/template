This is a preview version of FireCMS PRO. While we don't expect major changes, we are still working on the final
release. The documentation is still a work in progress, and we are working on improving it. If you have any feedback,
please let us know.
:::

FireCMS PRO is the self-hosted version of FireCMS. It is designed for projects that require more control over the
infrastructure, data and user management. It is a great option for companies that need to comply with specific regulations, or that have specific requirements that are not covered by the cloud version.

FireCMS PRO is a fully open-source project, and it is built on top of Firebase, Firestore, and Firebase Authentication.
It is designed to be deployed on your own infrastructure, and it is fully customizable.

It allows you a high level of customization, and it is designed to be extended with your own components,
authentication providers, custom views, dashboard, custom logic, you name it.

You can even replace Firebase with your own backend, as long as you implement the required interfaces.

### Create a new project using the CLI

To create a new project using the CLI, you can run the following command:
```bash
npx create-firecms-app my-pro-cms --pro
```
or:

```bash
yarn create firecms-app my-pro-cms --pro
```

This will create a new FireCMS PRO project in the `my-pro-cms` folder.
A FireCMS project is a React application that you can customize to fit your needs.
The initial project will have a basic structure with a few collections and a couple of custom views.

### Running the project

To run the project, you run the following commands:

```bash
cd my-pro-cms
yarn
yarn dev
```

This will install the dependencies and start the development server.
